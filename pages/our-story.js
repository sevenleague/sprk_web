          <p>What comes to mind when you first think of dating apps?..... Superficiality? Hook-ups?.... “Here for a fun time not a long time”?</p>
          <p>Regardless, I’m sure you’ve heard (or experienced) at least one dating app horror story!</p>
          <p>… And the sad truth is, so have we. We’ve experienced and heard of matches not being respectful. They’ve been demeaning, creepy and damn right critical. </p>
          <h4 className="font-bold text-white text-2xl mb-4">But dating should be fun, it should be safe, and you should always feel worthy.</h4>
          <p>We wanted to design an app that empowers you, us and everybody else. An app that focuses on who we are, rather than solely aesthetics. </p>
          <p>(drumroll please...) Introducing Sprk!! The world’s first neuro-backed artificial intelligence (AI) app!</p>
          <p>Sprk’s technology has been 30 years in the making. This technology started with research using brain imaging, extended to neuroeconomics, then relationships between brains and genes and ultimately the discovery of Relative Preference Theory (RPT). RPT is able to predict people’s behaviors and values, and has been integrated into cutting-edge “explainable AI” (eAI) by Sprk.  
          </p>
          <p>At Sprk, we use our patented eAI to focus on the core roots of someone by looking at how they engage in the world. We all swim through a vast ocean of emotion and Sprk utilizes the wakes we leave to make recommendations.</p>
          <p>Sprk is not just an app that brings people together – it also allows them to learn more about themselves through the process – this is a win-win, for finding others and for gaining deeper insight about oneself!</p>
          <p>As a company driven by women, we take pride in working to empower everyone. Therefore, we are committed to donating a portion of Sprk’s revenue to organisations whose mission aligns with this purpose.</p>
          <p>Sprk is dedicated to you, and introducing you to those you might otherwise never meet.</p>
