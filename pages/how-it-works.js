          <p>But not Sprk. </p>
          <p>Sprk is unique. </p>
          <p><span className="font-bold">Our matchmaking system,</span> moving away from conventional online dating tropes, is based on cognitive neuroscience, specifically relative preference theory (RPT), which has been built into a new gen artificial intelligence (AI), or more specifically explainable AI (eAI). </p>
          <p>We use eAI to calibrate how you emotionally swim through the world, leaving a pattern of positive and negative preferences behind you. This pattern reflects BOTH what attracts you and what you find aversive in the events of life. Sprk then matches your patterns of positive and negative preference with the patterns of others. </p>
          <p>But …... <span className="font-bold">How does it work?</span> </p>
          <p>You will:</p>
          <p>1. Provide basic information to which sets up a relationship framework for Sprk’s RPT Engine</p>
          <p>2. Rate images which quantifies your patterns of positive and negative preferences using the RPT Engine</p>
          <p>3. Complete your personal profile page</p>
          <p>Then...we will:</p>
          <p>4. Use the RPT engine to balances your positive and negative preferences to place you in 1 of 5 categories (preservers, mediators, thinkers, seekers, adventurers)</p>
          <p>5. Provide recommendations based on your relationship framework requests and how the RPT Engine maps you with others in a multidimensional preference space.</p>
          <p>6. Provide you with your own preference patterns, enabling you to see how you swim through the emotional waters of this world.</p>
          <p>When we have similar patterns for engaging with the world, it is easier to communicate, pick activities of shared interest, and have fun. If we devote too much time dealing with differences, the relationship becomes agonizing and spiteful, absent of love and respect.  </p>
          <p>So are you still curious? Yes? Check out Sprk’s dictionary for the <span className="font-bold">definitions of the 5 categories and 15 patterns</span> to make sure that you fully understand how YOU swim through the world.</p>
          <p>Whether you are looking to understand yourself better, a serious relationship, or something casual, we promise Sprk will help you in one way or another!</p>
          <p>We hope that this “how it works” explanation has helped you understand Sprk and our AI technology more. If you have any questions, please email <a href="mailto:support@sparkai.us">support@sparkai.us</a></p>
